    From childhood’s hour I have not been
    <br>
    As others were—I have not seen
    <br>
    As others saw—I could not bring
    <br>
    My passions from a common spring—
    <br>
    From the same source I have not taken
    <br>
    My sorrow—I could not awaken
    <br>
    My heart to joy at the same tone—
    <br>
    And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
    <br>
    Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
    <br>
    Of a most stormy life—was drawn
    <br>
    From ev’ry depth of good and ill
    <br>
    The mystery which binds me still—
    <br>
    From the torrent, or the fountain—
    <br>
    From the red cliff of the mountain—
    <br>
    From the sun that ’round me roll’d
    <br>
    In its autumn tint of gold—
    <br>
    From the lightning in the sky
    <br>
    As it pass’d me flying by—
    <br>
    From the thunder, and the storm—
    <br>
    And the cloud that took the form
    <br>
    (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
    <br>
    Of a demon in my view—
    <br><br>
